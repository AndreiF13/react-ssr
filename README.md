## Overview

`react-ssr` is a minimalistic solution to achieve server-side rendering with a few lines of code and a simple ruleset. The simple ruleset is outlined with performance in mind, and must be followed to server side render React apps effectively. It supports React Router 4, which introduced challenges to server-side rendering by making you have to declare data calls at a route level. `react-ssr` allows you to make those calls at a component level.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install react-ssr --save
```

We recommend you use the babel plugin too. Add the babel plugin to your `.babelrc`.
```sh
$ npm install babel-plugin-react-ssr --save-dev
```
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "react-ssr"
  ]
}
```

## Adding to your server

Firstly, you'll need to use the module on your Node server and have some static routes of your app setup. The below example uses express:

- Your Node JS express server
`server.js`
```js
import express from 'express'
import ssr from 'react-ssr'
import routes from './routes'

const app = express()
const renderer = ssr({ routes })

app.get('*', renderer) // send all routes to ssr
```

- Static routes of your React app
`routes.js`
```js
import HomePage from './HomePage'
import NotFoundPage from './NotFoundPage'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    exact: true,
    component: HomePage
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    redirectTo: '/'
  },
  {
    path: '**',
    component: NotFoundPage
  }
]

export default routes
```

## Fetching data

There's one important rule: If you want to make a data call, and you'd like it to be server side rendered correctly, you'll need to use a special method for this. It's a static method that sits in your React component called `fetchData`. `react-ssr` will execute this before it begins rendering your app on the server and inject the result of it into the components props.

Here's an example:

```js
const pageContent = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  fetch('/api')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(resolve)
    .catch(reject)
})

class Navigation extends React.Component {
  static fetchData ({req, match}) {
    // params is an object of params from the matched React route
    return {
      content: pageContent() // becomes available as this.props.content
    }
  }

  render () {
    console.log(this.props.content)
    return <span />
  }
```

üèÜ You should now have server-side rendering setup.

-

**Unless you chose not to install the babel plugin**. Raise an issue if you'd like an alternative to the babel plugin. Anyway, without it, here's what you'll need to do:

- Any component with a static fetchData must be wrapped at the bottom with our higher order component:
```jsx
import ssrFetchData from 'react-ssr/lib/fetchData'

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  static fetchData () {}
}

export default ssrFetchData(MyComponent)
```

- Your route/page/top-level components should have a waitsFor static array containing components required for fetchData calls, e.g:
```jsx
class MyPage extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <Example />
    )
  }
}

MyPage._ssrWaitsFor = [
  Example,
  SomeOtherChildWithStaticFetchData
]

export default MyPage
```

And your done.

## Notes

There's a few things to consider here. Since data fetching occurs before rendering begins, you'll have these points to deal with:

- You can't access `this` inside your static `fetchData`. Chain API calls together in parent components if they are dependent.
- You must use static routes. Dynamic routing (react router v4) takes place as your app is rendering, but this has huge performance implications for server side rendering. So, we must have a static set of routes that we can match against before rendering begins.
- Components that are dynamically rendered with static `fetchData` will not be server-side rendered. So, if you're programatically doing something like this, it won't server-side render, but instead show a loading spinner and client-side render:
```jsx
const DynamicComponent = components['MyComponent']
return <DynamicComponent />
```

Also, there's a couple of caveats for now. We're working on them:

- Only tested with React Router v4 static routing for now. v3 or less support will likely be added soon. Ultimately we recommend you upgrade
- Untested on anything but flat routes currently (about to move onto nested)
- Your React components _must_ must be an export default, higher order components should be wrapped with decorators, rather than inline around the class name:
```jsx
@myDecorator
class MyComponentName extends Component {}

export default MyComponentName
```
There is a way to avoid the above if you absolutely must. There are rare cases where you can't use the decorator, or you might just not be in a position to use them for some reason. Import the HOC manually and define it like below, ensuring you use a unique variable name for the wrapped instance (even if you use the babel plugin, it will see this and skip it):
```jsx
import fetchData from 'react-ssr/lib/fetchData'
import { observer } from 'mobx-react'

class MyComponent extends Component {}

const variableWithUniqueName = observer(MyComponent)
export default fetchData(variableWithUniqueName)
```
